# NBA Statistics Dashboard

 My goal is to present NBA player statistics in an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.

All of the player data is in an SQL database which the user can query using the user interface on Streamlet.
Currently I have the average career points available for any input player name. I would like to do the same for rebounds and assists with different options for the output variable.

If I am able with my time I would like to include an option for graphing individual statistics over time and comparing players on the same graph.
