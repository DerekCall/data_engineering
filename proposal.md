# Project Proposal - NBA Player Statistics Dashboard

#### Question/need:
* My goal in this project is to use data from the NBA to create a dashboard of interactive statistics based on user input for either an
individual player or team over a certain span of time.

#### Data Description:
* I will be using the nba_api: https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba/ to gather the data from the past 40-50 seasons.
* Features that I will be gathering include all player/team statistics available over this time.


#### Tools:
* This information is being accessed using the nba_api in Python and then data manipulation/feature engineering using Pandas.
* I will store all the data in a SQL database.

#### MVP Goal:
* A minimum viable product will be providing player or team statistics in a graphical interface.
